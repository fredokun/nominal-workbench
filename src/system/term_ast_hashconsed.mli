(** This type is created by the hashconsing algorithm.
    It allows to store the already calculated hashed value, which is used byt
    the hlist and permits a more efficient hashconsing of lists *)

(**
    Type of a hashsconsed list, for the subterms of a term.
*)
type 'a hlist = 'a hashed list

(** The representation is the following:
    - Free variables and constants are represented by their real value;
    - A binded variables uses a de Bruijn index, which is mandatory to be able
    to reason about the context;
    - A binder is a list of ids, which are the ids of hashed values in a hlist;
    - A term is simply a name with a hashconsed list of already hashconsed
    terms.

(** Since the hashconsed term loses the variables name to be able to reason
    modulo alpha-conversion, we export a representation of the lost binders and
    variables names into a tree identical as the hterm_raw created. *)
